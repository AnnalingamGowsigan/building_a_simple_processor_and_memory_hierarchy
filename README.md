# Develope an 8-bit single-cycle CPU with memory hierarchy

- Designed an 8-bit single cycle CPU with associated memory hierarchy using **Verilog**. The processor includes an ALU, register files, control logic, forwarding unit, data memory, data cache, instruction memory and instruction cache.

- Simulated processor behavior using **Icarus Verilog** and input and output signals were observed using **GTKWave**.

- Tested behavior using **ARM assembly code**.

- Techniques: `RISC-V`, `Caching`
